Why use an existing game engine when you can waste time making your own that probably isn't even that good?

Welp. This is basically a personal project of mine. It's been in existence since early 2015, but it's only now going to the internets because I'm lazy.

It used to be heavily based on the Minicraft source code (Notch's project for that one Luden Dare), but since then I'd say the only remenant of it lies in some of the concepts of the engine. Little Ctrl+C Ctrl+V code remains.

So, why use this?

Pros:
No dependencies! Yep, this is all written entirely using the native Java libraries.

Cons:
No dependencies! Which means that lots of features that third-party libraries unlock are unavaliable. The most obvious example of such is Audio, where the native libraries are only capable of playing back .wav files, instead of the much smaller .ogg files common elsewhere.
