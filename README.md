Why use an existing game engine when you can waste time making your own that probably isn't even that good?

Welp. This is basically a personal project of mine. It's been in existence since early 2015, but it's only now going to the internets because I'm lazy.

It used to be heavily based on the Minicraft source code (Notch's project for that one Luden Dare), but since then I'd say the only remenant of it lies in some of the concepts of the engine. Little Ctrl+C Ctrl+V code remains.
